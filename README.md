This is my world for interactions modpack

This world will be automatic backuped each 1h due the backup script. In case think it's necessary, just update the last line of backupscript.py (Don't remember the file name but the python script)

Also there is the properties and the run script in case it's needed but the modpack and version is: FTB Interactions @ 2.0.9

The server is whitelisted. If you reach here somehow and want to play search me and send me a PM than I add u to the server :) (You can always create a issue lol)

Hope I don't lost the modpack map again with this ^^

Also, I've almost forgot about it... If I need to run that thing again cause I lost something, the modpack can be downloaded from FTB page.

Just move the start.sh file and run it inside of a screen Also need to configure and setup the entire envoirment for minecraft and then add and configure then run python autobackup.py inside of a screen terminal again (to let it running)

To understand how to setup this server on oracle cloud you can use this (tutorial)[https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/post/how-to-set-up-and-run-a-really-powerful-free-minecraft-server-in-the-cloud] And instead installing last java version, install the 1.8 version due compatibility issues. Also, of course instead of downloading the minecraft server from the FTB page.

Actually it is: https://api.modpacks.ch/public/modpack/5/121/server/arm/linux But it can change in the future (Also the arm version). But I'll let the file here if you want to run it. (It still will need to download the mods and blablabla) But just run the script than after copy this world to the folder Hope we enjoy it having hourly backups.
